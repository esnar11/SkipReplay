This is a [BakkesMod](https://www.bakkesmod.com/) plugin that automatically skips the replay for you(simulates skip replay key press). 

Can be enabled/disabled with the `toggleskipreplay` command which can be mapped to any key through the plugin settings menu.

An option is available in the plugin settings menu to re-enable auto skipping after a match ends.

**NOTE:** If you have installed this plugin before version 1.2 you will have a stray `SkipReplay.dll` and a `settings` folder in your bakkesmod root directory.
